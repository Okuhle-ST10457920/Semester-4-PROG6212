For the Contract Monthly Claims POE,
firstly i implemented the auto-calculation feature to allow lecturers to easily input their hours worked and hourly rate, and submit claims.
Secondly i developed the automated system to verify claims and enable reviews, and process submitted claims.
Thirdly i created the HR view and developed the functionality to automate claim processing and manage lecturer data, and improve overall efficiency.
On the fourth day, i created the table ClaimHR in the database and inserted the HR details in the database for storage.
Lastly I implemented security where the HR can enter the username and password to view the HR page.
